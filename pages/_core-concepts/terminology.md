### Terminology

The following terms will be used throughout this document to describe Aranya deployments on **endpoints.** These deployments, or **instances,** are further defined as specific **entities,** or devices, once the instance is assigned a specific set of cryptographic keys used for identity and authentication and are governed by written **policy**.

**Endpoint:** A piece of hardware (e.g. IoT device, computer, cellular phone, etc.) or software (e.g. application) on which Aranya is integrated.

**Instance:** A single deployment of the Aranya software. To note, each endpoint can have one or many instances deployed on it.

**Entity:** You can think of this as a specific device identity and it is used to identify an instance by assigning it a set of cryptographic keys used for identity and authentication, allowing it to govern the behavior of the endpoint.

**Policy:** Defines specific behaviors, or accepted actions with corresponding commands, that will be generated and executed on the endpoint.
