# What is Aranya?
Aranya is an access governance and secure data exchange platform for organizations to control their critical data and services. Access governance is a mechanism to define, enforce, and maintain the set of rules and procedures to secure your systemâ€™s behaviors. Data governance is a more narrowed approach for applying the same mechanism to specifically address access permissions of all data in the system.

## What can Aranya do?
Aranya is useful anywhere you have data that needs to be reconciled, sent securely, or restricted. Possible uses could be sending data between IoT devices, files or messages between users, encryption keys between computer systems or information between embedded devices. Anywhere you have a need for permission management, such as Identity and Access Management (IdAM). Aranya gives you the ability to apply access controls over stored or shared resources all in one place.
