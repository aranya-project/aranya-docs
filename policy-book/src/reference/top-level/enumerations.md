# Enumerations

```
enum MyEnum {
    A,
    B,
}
```

Enumerations are defined in `enum` blocks, which name the enumeration
and define a list of items inside curly braces. The items are
syntactically identifiers and should be unique within the enumeration.
Duplicate items is a compile error.

The type of an enumeration is `enum ❮name❯`. See also the [Enumerations
type](../types/enums.md) for usage information.
